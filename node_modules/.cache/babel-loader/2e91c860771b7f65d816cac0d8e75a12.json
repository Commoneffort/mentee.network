Our platform is a place where people can assist each other in creating a community whose main objective is helping others in disclosing their potential and driving to personal success. We want to shine a light on those who have dreams, ambition and willingness to work and change their lives. We give them the tools to make their efforts visible and appreciated. We give them the possibility to raise funds for their creations, projects and even for their own self-development. We believe that people can be anything they want to be if certain conditions are met and enough effort is put into the process. In the process of achieving a goal, other individuals play often an important role. These individuals are like angels that we meet on our way. There are many people who are willing to be angels and to be a change for others. Our mission is to bring them as Mentors so they can support others and make a difference in their lives. We strive to let good people help those who want to be given a chance. We let Mentors find people who they believe in and empower their Mentees with the knowledge, experience and moral support. We want Mentors and Mentees to mutually get satisfied with the reciprocal value they have to offer and which they can interchange. A Mentor has the financial possibility and the knowledge to share while a Mentee has his own time, effort and individual abilities to sell. The two combined together may result in a success.\"));\n}\n\nexport default Mission;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/anetasmac/mentee-react/src/components/Mission.js"],"names":["React","Mission"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,SAASC,OAAT,GAAmB;AACf,SACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,eADF,EAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,mBAFF,EAGE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,giDAHF,CADF;AAmBD;;AAGH,eAAeA,OAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\"\n \nfunction Mission (){\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>MISSION</h2>\n        <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>\n        <p>\nWe are on a mission of empowering people to unleash their potential, give them freedom and help them create.\n\nOur platform is a place where people can assist each other in creating a community whose main objective is helping others in disclosing their potential and driving to personal success.\n\nWe want to shine a light on those who have dreams, ambition and willingness to work and change their lives.
