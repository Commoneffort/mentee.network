A record-breaking, Grand Slam-winning player, Ana is not just admired for her ability and dedication, but for her endearing personality and extensive philanthropic work across the globe. Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1987, Ana first discovered her passion for tennis aged 4 while watching Monica Seles on TV. Inspired by Monica\\u2019s strength, speed and power, Ana encouraged her parents to buy her a racket and send her to tennis school, where she developed an even greater love of the game. Despite training in limited and often dangerous conditions during the NATO air strikes of the Kosovo War, Ana displayed immense passion and determination, attributes that are today considered her hallmark. Her considerable ability soon caught the eye of talent scouts and sponsors including adidas, who have remained in partnership with her to this day. In 2003 Ana turned pro, beginning her ascent to the top of the women\\u2019s world rankings, a coveted spot she held in 2008 after winning the French Open aged 21. Having previously reached the quarterfinals in her debut year of 2005 and the finals in 2007, winning the title at Roland Garros a year later was a career highlight and a dream come true. The win helped catapult her to international recognition - she currently ranks 7th in the world and is considered one of the most popular players in the women\\u2019s game. Not simply content with getting to the top of her sport, Ana enjoys being challenged intellectually; she has studied finance, has a keen interest in psychology and is a modern art lover, citing Mark Rothko and photographer Helmut Newton among her favorite artists. Embodying determination, empowerment and self-confidence, Ana is a modern sports icon for women across the globe and has graced the pages of Vogue, Harper\\u2019s Bazaar, Vanity Fair and TIME magazine. In addition, Ana has a strong social media influence with over 4 million followers across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Her personal website regularly attracts a million visitors a month. Off the court, Ana has been recognized for her charity and humanitarianism: she is a UNICEF National Ambassador for Serbia and recently became an ambassador of the Quercus Biasi Foundation, which helps improve the lives of children living in extreme poverty.\")));\n}\n\nexport default Members;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/anetasmac/mentee-react/src/components/Members.js"],"names":["React","Members"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,SAASC,OAAT,GAAoB;AAChB,SACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACC;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,6NAEC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAFD,EAGC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,y1EAHD,CADD,CADF;AAkBD;;AAGH,eAAeA,OAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\"\n \nfunction Members () {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"members\">\n      \t<div className=\"member-card\">\n      \t\timg src=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiav8u0lLnjAhVFzhoKHZrmCl4QjRx6BAgBEAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anaivanovic.com%2Fprofile&psig=AOvVaw3YXXvSzjLicY3jQJYipYLC&ust=1563356865981952/>\n        <h3>Ana Ivanovic</h3>\n        <p>About Ana\n        One of tennis’ best-loved stars, Ana Ivanovic defines the role of the modern athlete.
