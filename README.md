1.0 Introduction

We live in a world where many people cannot achieve their life goals because the external conditions like poverty, geographical localization, socio-cultural issues, etc. had a negative influence on their lives. We live in a world where success is tied mostly to good education but many don’t have access to it. Although the Internet is an enormous repository of knowledge, this knowledge is often disorganized and dispersed, costly or there’s simply not enough motivation for people to get in front of the computer to learn. 
Mentee is going to change this because thanks to its attention to mentorship. We aim at fostering the relationship between mentees and mentors because mentorship is the next big thing that empowers people and has the potential to turn anyone in a leader.
 
“A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself” 
— Oprah Winfrey
Mentors not only share their knowledge and experience with others but through the relationship developed with their mentees they provide moral support and stimulate personal and professional growth. This relationship can push people to new heights and make them achieve things they wouldn’t be otherwise capable of. This is why they can have a real impact on the people and their lives.
The power of mentorship is always more appreciated within communities of a certain kind, academic field or corporate setting. Mentorship it is slowly gaining traction in today’s society as always more people look for mentors online. Also there are always more people willing to be mentors and look proactively for people to dedicate their time to.
People who have achieved success often say that their success would never be possible without certain people who acted as mentors in their lives.

2.0 The vision

Mentee platform, powered by the EOS.IO software, wants to be the place where mentees and mentors meet and exchange knowledge and acquire new experiences, where they can establish a connection and begin the mentorship, bringing mutual benefit to both. 
The ability to have access to different mentors makes Mentee a perfect solution for unlimited access to knowledge which is retained in the minds of many people. Each experience and each successful story is different and only those who succeeded know what needs to be done to get there. Using Mentee, these people have the opportunity to access this knowledge and to connect with others to be more successful. Thanks to Mentee they can have a real positive impact on someone’s life.
Mentee Network’s goal is to create the world’s first on-chain educational platform where learning courses and scientific content can be stored. Through an API it can be  accessed by different decentralized applications as a peer-reviewed and trustworthy source of information. 
Though the mentorship the real focus of the platform as the end result is a blockchain Curriculum Vitae. Official education and past working experiences matter but it isn’t always the proof of what a person really knows. Life experiences, undocumented works or courses make often a big part of someone’s personal kit. The successful entrepreneurs without higher education are proof that what we learn during our lives is often more valuable than the titles on the paper. Mentee will bring onto the surface all these skills showing employers what mentees really know which will be beneficial for both parties.
Mentee Network has the potential to become a school for entrepreneurs where they get the knowledge and experience from mentors, complete tasks, create and work in teams and deliver results. It benefits not only mentees but also mentors as, through mentoring,  they get to reflect on their own leadership style and methods, which can make them more thoughtful and intentional about own leadership. Mentee Network can be used as online classes where students and teachers meet.
There’s a reason why this app is built on the EOS blockchain and this is because blockchain is an immutable ledger. Whatever new skill and progress will be achieved by the mentee, it will be recorded in a permanent way. This means that the blockchain CV will act as a live certificate of the real knowledge and skills possessed that can be updated in real time as new information is being added.
